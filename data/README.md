Provide the neccessarry data in this directory, preferably by symlinking to a in mem location

You'll need the following scripts/json files:
* aircraft.json
* airports.json
* export.php
* heatmap.php
* mesh.json
* planeHistory.php
* ships.json
* shipTrack.php
* station.json

You find some examples in the directory, otherwise: Just use our live map as an example on data structure for now.

Data structure is very likely to change in the future. There are so many bad design decisions manifested in it, that it is inevitable to do some breaking changes.
